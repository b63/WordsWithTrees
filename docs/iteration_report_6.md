## Completed
Ted worked on implementing the feature to enable a user to sell a tree branch and the unit test for this feature.


## Problems and Struggles
Although it was Thanksgiving, our team members were still able to work on the project individually. By this time, we have already gotten used to the workflow of writing unit tests, developing feature within a branch, and merging completed working code into master.
