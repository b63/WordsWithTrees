# Iteration 6: Report

## Responsibilities
 - Add branches to the database: Bhavin, Nico
 - Render tree on the client-side by requesting pre-rendered tiles from the app
 - Buy a Tree Branch: Nico
 -Sell a Tree Branch: Ted


## Completed
Ted worked on implementing the feature to enable a user to sell a tree branch. He also worked on adding unit tests to the buying branches page.
Bhavin worked on creating the system to generate all the tiles of the trees at different zoom levels and adding them to the disk or the database. He created a CLI to render tiles to save the position of the tiles and the branches contained in each tile. Additionally, he generated he worked on generating tests to confirm that the tiles and all of the information that they hold is accurate and being saved in the right place.
Nico worked with Bhavin on generating the tiles at different zoom levels, but he focused on the view inventory and the buying screens. For the view inventory, he also created tests to check if branches owned by a user were being properly displayed. For the buying screen, he worked on displaying the branches that are available for purchase and also on filtering them based on the visibility of the branch and the price. 


## Problems and Struggles
Although it was Thanksgiving, our team members were still able to work on the project individually. By this time, we have already gotten used to the workflow of writing unit tests, developing feature within a branch, and merging completed working code into master.


## Plan for Iteration 7
- Ensure that tree rendering on the front-end has low latency and is as responsive as possible: Bhavin
- Finish work on  the buy and sell system for branches including periodically adding layers to the branches: Ted, Bhavin, Nico
- Continue making UI improvements, and polishing the website by restructuring the website, fixing any glitches or hiccups, and possibly using CSS/Javascript animations to make the user experience feel smooth. Ted, Nico, Bhavin
- Write a Message on Tree Branch: Nico, Bhavin, Ted
- Bidding System (work on implmenting a bidding system when a new layer of trees spawns: Ted, Nico


## Plan for Iteration 8
- Work on features/user stories that were not completed from the previous iteration.
