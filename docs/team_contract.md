### 2. Decision Making Policy
Decisions will be made by consensus.

### 3. Expectation 
- Attendance, punctuality, and participation at meetings
   - Team members should not be late to weekly meetings
- Responsibility for fulfilling assigned tasks, meeting deadlines, etc.
  - Assigned tasks should be completed by deadlines. If a team member knows beforehand that an assigned task cannot be done on time, the team member should inform other team members so that other team members can finish the task before the deadline for that team member.
- Communication with the other team members
  - Active communication using the Messenger app.
 
### 4. Schedule for regular meetings
We are going to meet on Saturdays at 3pm in CNS E204.

### 5. Method of communication
Facebook Messenger group and in person.

### 6. Punitive measures for uncooperative team members 
If a team member isn’t meeting their obligations to the group, we will first send them an e-mail detailing in what areas they haven’t been meeting the expectations based on our team contract and wait for an e-mail response in the following 24 hours. Once we have received the e-mail and there is no noticeable improvement from them in the following week, we will have a dedicated time to talk with them about it in the next team meeting. If the person is still falling short, they will be forced to buy pizzas for the rest of the group and we will bring the issue up to the professor.
